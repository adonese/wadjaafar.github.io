    <title>Meet, recipe: making foods for dummies during an epidemic</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>A collection for open source food recipes</h1>
    <p><em>It is just recipes dude</em></p>

    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>There are tons of website all over the internet about food recipes. And frankly, they are the top on their game.
        Making a new site just for that can be considered as what we call in Bird Society <em>Dick Move</em>. But, there are good reasons as to why this website is the best one ever, and here you go:
    
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gender neutral: all female dominant website just assume our genders. Shame on you! <a href="feministing.com/2015/02/03/how-using-they-as-a-singular-pronoun-can-change-the-world/">[1]</a></li>
        <li>Most of these tutorials are lacking behind to what we have in software. Like, i know i have to put rice, salt, but i need a step by step guide</li>
        <li>Risky assumptions: many of these, female dominated recipe sites make very risky assumptions. In the event an item was missing, it makes perfect sense to offer alternatives</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Meet recipe: making foods for dummies during an epidemic</h2>
